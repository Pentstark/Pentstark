# Quantum Cryptography: Preparing for the Quantum Threat

## Introduction

The advent of quantum computing poses unprecedented challenges to traditional cryptographic systems. This article explores quantum cryptography as a defense mechanism against quantum-enabled attacks.

## The Quantum Threat Landscape

### Current Cryptographic Vulnerabilities

Quantum computers threaten:
- **RSA and ECC algorithms** through Shor's algorithm
- **Digital signatures** and key exchange protocols
- **Symmetric encryption** through Grover's algorithm

### Timeline of Quantum Risk

```
2025-2030:     Cryptographically relevant quantum computers emerge
2030-2035:     Large-scale quantum attacks become feasible
2035+:         Current public-key cryptography becomes obsolete
```

## Quantum Cryptography Fundamentals

### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

QKD leverages quantum mechanics principles:

```javascript
// Simplified QKD protocol simulation
class QuantumKeyDistribution {
  constructor(alice, bob) {
    this.alice = alice;
    this.bob = bob;
    this.quantumChannel = new QuantumChannel();
    this.classicalChannel = new ClassicalChannel();
  }

  distributeKey() {
    // Alice prepares quantum states
    const bases = this.alice.generateRandomBases();
    const bits = this.alice.generateRandomBits();

    // Send photons through quantum channel
    this.quantumChannel.sendPhotons(bases, bits);

    // Bob measures received photons
    const bobBases = this.bob.generateRandomBases();
    const bobBits = this.bob.measurePhotons(bobBases);

    // Classical reconciliation
    return this.classicalChannel.reconcile(bases, bobBases, bits, bobBits);
  }
}
```

### Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)

PQC algorithms resistant to quantum attacks:

1. **Lattice-based cryptography** (CRYSTALS-Kyber)
2. **Code-based cryptography** (Classic McEliece)
3. **Multivariate cryptography** (Rainbow)
4. **Hash-based signatures** (SPHINCS+)

## Implementation Strategies

### Hybrid Cryptographic Systems

Combining classical and quantum-resistant algorithms:

```yaml
# Example hybrid certificate structure
Certificate:
  Subject: example.com
  PublicKey:
    ClassicalKey: RSA-4096
    PostQuantumKey: CRYSTALS-Kyber-1024
  Signature:
    Algorithm: Dilithium-5
    Value: [signature bytes]
```

### Migration Planning
