## The Three Pillars of Zero Trust

### 1. Identity Verification

Every user and device must be continuously authenticated:

\`\`\`javascript
// Example Zero Trust identity verification
const verifyIdentity = async (request) => {
  const user = await authenticateUser(request.token);
  const device = await verifyDevice(request.deviceId);
  const context = await assessRisk(request.context);

  return {
    access: user.verified && device.trusted && context.safe,
    conditions: generateAccessConditions(user, device, context)
  };
};
\`\`\`

**Key Components:**
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
- **Device health checks**

    const bases = this.alice.generateRandomBases();
    const bits = this.alice.generateRandomBits();

    // Send photons through quantum channel
    this.quantumChannel.sendPhotons(bases, bits);

    // Bob measures received photons
    const bobBases = this.bob.generateRandomBases();
    const bobBits = this.bob.measurePhotons(bobBases);

    // Classical reconciliation
    return this.classicalChannel.reconcile(bases, bobBases, bits, bobBits);
  }
}

## Introduction

Blockchain technology promises revolutionary improvements in security, transparency, and decentralization. However, blockchain systems face unique security challenges that require specialized knowledge and approaches. This article explores the complex security landscape of blockchain technology and provides practical solutions.

## Blockchain Security Fundamentals

### The Blockchain Trilemma

Blockchain systems must balance three competing priorities:

\`\`\`
Security ↔ Decentralization ↔ Scalability
\`\`\`

**Trade-offs:**
- **Bitcoin:** High security, maximum decentralization, limited scalability
- **Ethereum:** Good security, moderate decentralization, improving scalability
- **Centralized ledgers:** Maximum scalability, minimal decentralization, variable security

### Attack Vectors in Blockchain

#### 1. Consensus Mechanism Attacks

**Proof of Work (PoW) Attacks:**
\`\`\`javascript
// 51% attack simulation
class AttackSimulator {
  calculateAttackCost(networkHashrate, attackerHashrate) {
    const honestHashrate = networkHashrate - attackerHashrate;
    const attackThreshold = networkHashrate / 2;

    return {
      feasible: attackerHashrate > attackThreshold,
      cost: this.estimateAttackCost(attackerHashrate, honestHashrate),
      duration: this.estimateAttackDuration(attackerHashrate, honestHashrate)
    };
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Proof of Stake (PoS) Attacks:**
- **Long-range attacks** on finality
- **Nothing-at-stake** problems
- **Stake grinding** vulnerabilities

#### 2. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

**Common Smart Contract Flaws:**
\`\`\`solidity
// Vulnerable contract example
contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount); // Race condition!
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        msg.sender.transfer(amount); // Reentrancy vulnerability!
    }
}
\`\`\`

**Secure Contract Patterns:**
\`\`\`solidity
// Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
contract SecureContract {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount);
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount; // Effect first
        msg.sender.transfer(amount); // Interaction last
    }
}
\`\`\`

## Layered Security Approach

### 1. Network Layer Security

#### Node Security

**Hardening Blockchain Nodes:**
\`\`\`bash
# Secure node configuration
{
  "maxconnections": 50,
  "listen": true,
  "server": false,
  "rpcbind": "127.0.0.1",
  "rpcallowip": "10.0.0.0/8",
  "rpcpassword": "strong_password_here",
  "prune": 550,
  "daemon": true
}
\`\`\`

**DDoS Protection:**
- **Rate limiting** on P2P connections

  const priceRatio = currentPrice / initialPrice;
  const loss = 2 * Math.sqrt(priceRatio) / (1 + priceRatio) - 1;
  return Math.abs(loss) * poolShare;
};
\`\`\`
